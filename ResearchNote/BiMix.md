## Bi-Mix: Bidirectional Mixing for Domain Adaptive Nighttime Semnatic Segmentation

#### Research Question
How to utilize the information in coarsely aligned day-night image pairs and to benefit both translation model and segmentation model bidirectionally?

#### Motivation
1. Inspired by work DANNet, there are some issues are not considered. 1) The information in coarsely aligned image pairs are not utilized during image translation, 2) the translation model benefits the segementation model significantly, how the segementation model provide little guidance to translation module, 3) the imbalance issue in nighttime images is ignored. Above three issues affect the performance and efficiency of the nighttime segmentation task.
